## Intro
Recently I needed temperature and humidity sensors for a project and bought a few DHT-11 sensors. 
I was curious how accurate these sensors were.
I deceided to wire a few of them up to an Arduino Nano and take some data.

## Materials

The materials list is short and sweet.

## Method

My method for taking data was to collect 200 data points over a period of 200 seconds (i.e. measure from each sensor every second). To get a general sense of what the temperature should be, I took a picture of my thermostat's readout (a little more than 70Â°F).

## Code

The code is rather simple as I used the Adafruit & DHT Library. I printed the values to the serial monitor in a CSV style format so that is could later be easily pasted into a CSV file.

## Results

Overall the results were not that suprising as I was not expecting these sensors to be super accurate. It seems like the
