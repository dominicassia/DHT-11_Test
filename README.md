# DHT-11_Test
Testing multiple DHT-11 Sensors to determine the accuracy

## Contents


## Intro
Recently I needed temperature and humidity sensors for a project and bought a few DHT-11 sensors. 
I was curious how accurate these sensors were.
I deceided to wire a few of them up to an Arduino Nano and take some data.

## Materials

The materials list is short and sweet.

|Items|
|-----|
|DHT-11 (x3)|
|Arduino Nano|
|A few jumper wires|
|A breadboad|

## Method

My method for taking data was allowing the sensors to take data every second for 200 seconds. My apartment does not have a digital readout thermostat, however, I took a picture of the thermostat to document the general temperature range.
